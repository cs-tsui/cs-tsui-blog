    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><p>Painting is about 95% complete. I just need to mask off some areas on the handles of the anti ship sword and the beam cannon as well as the beam rifle to spray it in a dark gray for a bit of contrast.</p>

<p><p>Some beam cannon parts are masked off after spraying it in a dark green to give it a two tone color variation.<img src="http://i151.photobucket.com/albums/s148/Tomster831/MG%20Destiny%20WIP/Part%202/P8030540_979x734.jpg" alt="Photobucket" border="0" /></p>

Results can be seen below. I think it turned out rather nicely.

<p>Weapons put together.</p>

<p>Accident happened and the swivel joint on the handle broke. I&rsquo;ll probably just glue it back on&hellip; Guess it won&rsquo;t be swiveling anymore.</p>

All the body pieces are done. Pardon my shaky hands and blurry photos. (Wings aren&rsquo;t attached because the pistons were just painted and need to wait for those to dry)

<p>That&rsquo;s pretty much it. Just waiting for the small amount of gold parts to dry up and then on to the enamel wash and decals. The gold below is some left over Testor spray can I  had in the stash. A lot quicker than busting out the airbrush just to paint the gold pieces.</p>

<p>Oh and the Hi-Nu is pretty close to being done. Just need to touch up on a few things and it&rsquo;ll be finished.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The kit was already snapped together when I first got it a couple of years ago. I had planned on painting this kit from the start so all the parts were already prepared for painting (pegs were cut for easier removal of the pieces and the pieces were sanded).</p>


<p>As usually Tamiya Arylics are my paint of choice. On with the painting:</p>

<p>
The frame was sprayed with Krylon's Short Cut spray can (Chrome) when the kit was first snapped together. Now I'm just spraying it in the same color since the paint was pretty scratched up from putting on and removing the armor pieces.

<p>All the gray, blue, red, and yellow pieces are done and top coated with Future. I went with two shades of gray (which isnt' very obvious) as well as two shades of red. The purple-ish blue is all in the same shade though.

<p>Destiny's head is one of my favorite Gundam head designs. The front camera and the eyes are still stickers for now. I haven't decided if I would paint it since the stickers look pretty good already.<img src="http://i151.photobucket.com/albums/s148/Tomster831/MG%20Destiny%20WIP/P8010494_979x734.jpg" alt="Photobucket" border="0" /></a></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The kit is almost finish and here are several pics I've taken during the process. Not too many pictures were taken during this build.</p>


<p><p>The entire kit was AB with Tamiya Acrylics, and gloss coated with Future for panel lining and decals.</p>

<p>The internal frame is painted in gunmetal.</p>

<p>Snapped together after everything was painted (Excluding the fuel tanks).</p>

<p>Bought the waterslide decal set for the Hi-Nu as well as several others.</p>
