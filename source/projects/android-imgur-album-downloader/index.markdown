### Summary

An Android application for downloading Imgur albums to your device. It is stil a work in progress, but the core features are working:

* Parsing and getting the links of an album given a URL
* Downloading the images to external storage (i.e SD card or emulated storage)
* Added album list persistance (using an embarassingly primative method)
