### Summary

A personal project that is an extension to the cache simulator I had to implement in my Computer Architecture class. The original project was a command-line based program written in Java. This project gives a way to graphical visualize cache read/write operations with a web frontend.

The link below directs to the Github page of the visualizer. An arbitrary trace file is given to send read/write instructions to the cache every second, and as the operation gets carried out, the tables below gets updated with the instruction information. A green pulse is a hit, a red pulse is a miss.
