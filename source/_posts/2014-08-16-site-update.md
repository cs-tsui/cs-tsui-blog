Finally got around to migrating my site off of Wordpress. I've read good things about Octopress, so that's what the new site is based on. It is relatively straightforward to migrate the posts into the Octopress/Jekyll markdown format using the included tools. 

Currently the site is using a popular theme called Whitespace. Hopefully I will get around to customizing the theme a bit in the near future.

More updates that will be coming:

*	import scale modeling posts
*	rehost images
*	add project pages
