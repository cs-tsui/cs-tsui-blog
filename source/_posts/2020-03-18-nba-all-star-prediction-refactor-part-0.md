For the course project in the Data and Visual Analytics course in the MS Analytics program at Georgia Tech, our topic of choice was to experiement with data analytics techniques to predict the NBA All-Star selection of the 2020 season. Ever since the course was over, I've wanted to fully refactor and productionize the data pipeline and the machine learning models required to automate the prediction process.

In part 0 of this series of posts, it serves as the documentation of the state of the project as an introduction of sorts.
