<p>The kit was already snapped together when I first got it a couple of years ago. I had planned on painting this kit from the start so all the parts were already prepared for painting (pegs were cut for easier removal of the pieces and the pieces were sanded).</p>

As usually Tamiya Arylics are my paint of choice. On with the painting:

The frame was sprayed with Krylon's Short Cut spray can (Chrome) when the kit was first snapped together. Now I'm just spraying it in the same color since the paint was pretty scratched up from putting on and removing the armor pieces.

<p>All the gray, blue, red, and yellow pieces are done and top coated with Future. I went with two shades of gray (which isnt' very obvious) as well as two shades of red. The purple-ish blue is all in the same shade though.

<p>Destiny's head is one of my favorite Gundam head designs. The front camera and the eyes are still stickers for now. I haven't decided if I would paint it since the stickers look pretty good already.<img src="http://i151.photobucket.com/albums/s148/Tomster831/MG%20Destiny%20WIP/P8010494_979x734.jpg" alt="Photobucket" border="0" /></a></p>
