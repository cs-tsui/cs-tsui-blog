<p>Finished photos of the 1/100 MG Mk II v2.0. The camera picks up a lot more dust/imperfections than the eye can see. This is the first kit that I tried preshading on and I think the outcome is pretty decent. Only the white parts are preshaded because all the colored parts were painted last year when I first started working on it until I ran out of white paint.</p>
<p>The kit will be considered finished for now, but I still need to touch up on the face area (lining) as well as apply decal solutions (when I get them), and then apply a final flat coat.</p>
<p>As usual the paints used are Tamiya Acrylics (except for the thrusters) and topcoated with Future. Decals used are the Bandai waterslides. The thrusters are an aluminum color from a spray can and the insides were painted over with clear red. I think the results look fairly close to the aftermarket machined thrusters that are far too expensive.</p>
