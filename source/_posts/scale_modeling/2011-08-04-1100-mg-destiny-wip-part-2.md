<p>Painting is about 95% complete. I just need to mask off some areas on the handles of the anti ship sword and the beam cannon as well as the beam rifle to spray it in a dark gray for a bit of contrast.

<p>Some beam cannon parts are masked off after spraying it in a dark green to give it a two tone color variation.<img src="http://i151.photobucket.com/albums/s148/Tomster831/MG%20Destiny%20WIP/Part%202/P8030540_979x734.jpg" alt="Photobucket" border="0" /></p>

Results can be seen below. I think it turned out rather nicely.

Weapons put together.

Accident happened and the swivel joint on the handle broke. I'll probably just glue it back on... Guess it won't be swiveling anymore.

All the body pieces are done. Pardon my shaky hands and blurry photos. (Wings aren't attached because the pistons were just painted and need to wait for those to dry)

That's pretty much it. Just waiting for the small amount of gold parts to dry up and then on to the enamel wash and decals. The gold below is some left over Testor spray can IÂ  had in the stash. A lot quicker than busting out the airbrush just to paint the gold pieces.

Oh and the Hi-Nu is pretty close to being done. Just need to touch up on a few things and it'll be finished.
